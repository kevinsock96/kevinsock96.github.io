     <p> This page is going to talk about who I am.<br>
        My name is Kevin, and I am a beginner coder and freshman at URI. I did 5 years in the Navy, and decided that it wasn't for me. I am hoping that this path will suit me better.<br>
      In my free time I really enjoy playing video games, and going to the gym. I think both are great stress releivers, which I think is needed for college! Thanks for taking the time and stopping by my page.</p></center>
